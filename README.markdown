This Drum Machine the third project I made for the 'Front End Development Libraries' course on FreeCodeCamp. I learned how to lift up state from child to parent by using a callback function, cool!  
You can try out the drum sounds by either clicking the buttons, or by pressing the corresponding letters on your keyboard. (Easiest is to go to the above mentioned URL).
